<H1>Microsoft AdventureWorks Sales Dashboard</H1>

<H2>Project Overview</H2>
In this project, I leveraged the Microsoft AdventureWorks sample databases to transform a typical business request into a practical analytics solution. The objective was to advance the company's internet sales reporting from static reports to dynamic, interactive visual dashboards.
</br>
</br>
This project was executed using sample data.

<H2>Business Request</H2>
The sample business request for this project highlighted the need for an improved reporting system. <b>The focus was on analyzing: sales of products, customer sales, and sales trends over time.</b> Key requests for this project were the ability to filter data by product and customer as each salesperson works on different products. Additionally, the integration of the 2021 budget data for performance comparison was necessary, with an emphasis on a two-year sales data retrospective.

<H2>Process</H2>
<b>1. User Stories Development:</b> User stories were crafted to guide the data cleaning and dashboard design, ensuring real-world applicability and utility.
</br>
<b>2. Data Cleaning with SQL:</b> The AdventureWorks databases were cleansed and prepped using SQL, ensuring high data quality for analysis.
</br>
<b>3. Budget Data Integration:</b> The 2021 budget data was incorporated from an Excel spreadsheet to compare actual sales with budgeted targets.
</br>
<b>4. Data Visualization with Power BI:</b> Data visualizations were then developed in Power BI, resulting in 3 dashboards:
  
    • Sales Overview: A comparative analysis of product sales vs budget, Sales by Product Category, Top 10 Customers and Products, and Sales by Customer location
    • Customer Details: A matrix of client sales filtered by top buying clients, Sales by Customer location, and Sales trends by month
    • Product Details: A matrix of product sales filtered by top-selling product items, Sales by Customer location, and Sales trends by month
<H2>Tools</H2>
• Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
</br>
• Microsoft Power BI
</br>
• Microsoft Excel

<H2>Outcome</H2>
The final deliverable was a set of interactive Power BI dashboards that offer a comprehensive view of the company's internet sales. Key features include:

• Dynamic filters for Customer location, Product Category, Product Sub-category, and Product Name
</br>
• Customizable views for Year and Month aiding in historical analysis
</br>
• Visual representations of sales trends and comparisons with integrated budget figures
